Server is just a P2P proxy.
"server"-type client connects, sends "s<name>". New room is created. Server responds "s" if it is successfully created.
"client"-type clients connect, send "c<name>". Are bound to new room. Server responds "c" if they are successfully bound and "f" if the room doesn't exist or another error happens. Eventually add error codes to "f".
The server-type client is notified "c<client ID>".
At any time, "client"-type clients can send data over the socket. This data is relayed in the form "<cliID><data>" to the server.
At any time, the "server"-type client can send data over the socket. If the message starts with the number, the number is read and it is sent to a client of that number; otherwise, it is sent everywhere.
