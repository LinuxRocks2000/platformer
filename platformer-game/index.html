            <p>
                Recently, Vladimir Putin, the evil oligarch of Russia ("evil" meaning "commits human rights violations", "violates the Genova treaty", and "tortures political opponents") invaded the Ukraine. <br />
                True to his evil definition, he has targeted civilians and used illegal weaponry such as vacuum explosives on the public. America's lawmakers, especially our president, have failed to intervene beyond sanctions which will not effect them enough to stop the attack. <br />
                <b>What does Russia care</b> if they are economically isolated? The Ukraine will not be left alone because America doesn't pay for Russian goods any more.<br />
                Thus, as owner of LinuxRocks2000.github.io and as a citizen of the United States of America, I send a message to the inactive lawmakers of America:
                <h2>STOP Russia from attacking the Ukraine. Provide them with all the equipment they need. Prevent a beautiful democracy from falling into the hands of evil oligarchs, and demonstrate yourself better than them.</h2>
                <h2>Save Ukraine!</h2>
