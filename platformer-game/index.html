            <h1>This is important</h1>
            <p>
                A fellow member of <span class="redacted">Firestorm Robotics, FRC 6341</span> recently borrowed some electrical components from me, with the promise that <span class="redacted">he</span> would return them soon.<br />
                <span class="redacted">He didn't.</span><br />
                These components are extremely important, both personally (for both of us) and from the perspective of our <span class="redacted">team</span> commitments, so I show this banner to make a plea: If you know <span class="redacted">him</span>, please tell <span class="redacted">him</span> that he really needs to send those components back.<br />
                Click this a couple times to make it go away.
