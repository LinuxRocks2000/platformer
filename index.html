        Welcome to Platformer! There are two versions you can play. The one you're probably used to is <a href="platformer-old">old platformer</a>,
        which has been moved to that location; it is a very simple platforming game. The <a href="platformer-game">new version</a> is much better -
        combat, health, improved physics, etc. I believe it has recently surpassed the older version's level count, and the levels are higher quality.
        Also, there's plenty art by the community that really makes it swaous.
