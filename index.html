        Welcome to Platformer! There are two versions you can play. The one you're probably used to is <a href="platformer-old">old platformer</a>, which has been moved to that location; it is a very simple platforming game. The <a href="platformer-game">new version</a> is much better - combat, health, improved physics, etc, but it's also very new and has nowhere near the number of levels.
